                simple list of specific, manageable tasks that need done:


to do:

- create user controller login method with session for user
- create ts login method to call the user controller login method

- it would be nice to be able to sort shopping items by type, and maybe only show a few at a time
- definitely styling for them, probably bootstrap cards with images





done (cut and paste in here after):

- add mock up of store contents
- add mock up of employee view
- add mock up of admin view
- add mock up of customer view
- add ngIf logic so that products from the database get displayed on store page
- create file of a couple dozen products that we can use to fill the database and
refill it later if it gets deleted, with urls for images
